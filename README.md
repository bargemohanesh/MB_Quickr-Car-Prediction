Quicker Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the Python code for a machine learning model that predicts used car prices based on data from Quicker (or similar platforms). This model utilizes a Linear Regression approach for price prediction.

Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (check with python --version)
Required libraries (install using pip install <package_name>):
pandas (data analysis)
numpy (numerical computations)
matplotlib (data visualization)
seaborn (advanced data visualization)
scikit-learn (machine learning)
sklearn.model_selection (train-test split)
sklearn.preprocessing (one-hot encoding)
sklearn.pipeline (pipeline creation)
sklearn.metrics (evaluation metrics)
pickle (model persistence - optional)
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://<your_github_username>/quicker_car_price_prediction.git
cd quicker_car_price_prediction
Data Preparation:

Download your cleaned Quicker car data (CSV or other format) and place it in the data directory (if applicable).
Ensure the data has columns relevant to car price prediction, such as:
Car model/make (e.g., "Maruti Suzuki Swift")
Year
Kilometers driven
Fuel type (e.g., "Petrol", "Diesel")
Include additional features that might be relevant based on your data and analysis.
Running the Script

Load the Data:

The script predict_car_price.py assumes your cleaned data is in a CSV file named quikr_car.csv. Modify the script to load your data if the file name or format differs.
The data cleaning steps in the code are commented out. If your data requires similar cleaning, uncomment and modify those sections as needed.
Train the Model:

The script performs train-test split, one-hot encoding for categorical features (name, company, fuel_type), creates a Linear Regression model pipeline, trains the model, and evaluates its performance using R-squared.
Saving the Model (Optional):

The code currently does not save the trained model. You can uncomment the pickle.dump line to save it as LinearRegressionModel.pkl for future use.
Execute the Script:

Bash

python predict_car_price.py
The script will display the R-squared score on the test set, indicating the model's performance.
Prediction

To predict the price of a new car, the script provides an example at the end where it predicts the price for a car with specific features.
Modify this section to include your desired car details and run the script.
Further Considerations

Data Quality: Ensure your data is accurate, clean, and representative to achieve reliable predictions.
Feature Engineering: Explore creating new features from existing ones based on domain knowledge, potentially improving model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Consider techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate in a different model) for potentially better accuracy.
Model Selection: For complex datasets, evaluate different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to find the best fit.
Deployment (Optional)

If you want to deploy this model for real-time web-based predictions, investigate frameworks like Flask or Django to create a user interface.
